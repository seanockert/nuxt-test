          accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the International Arbitration
          Association located in Australia or in Texas at a city of Teach Starter’s choosing in its
          discretion. Any such controversy or claim brought by User shall be arbitrated on an
          individual basis, and shall not be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or
          controversy of any other party. The judgment on the arbitration award may be entered into
          any court having jurisdiction thereof.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, Teach Starter may in its sole and absolute discretion commence a law suit
          regarding such controversy or claim in any court located in Australia or in the United
          States in its absolute discretion to bring suit in any city where User is located or Teach
          Starter or its subsidiary is located.
        </p>

        <p>13.8 Waiver</p>
        <p>
          If Teach Starter does not act in relation to a particular breach by a User of these Terms
