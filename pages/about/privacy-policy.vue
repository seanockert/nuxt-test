          <li>

          </li>
          <li>
            If Teach Starter receives unsolicited Personal Information about Users, Teach Starter

        <h2>2. Integrity of Personal Information</h2>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
          <li>
            Teach Starter takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal Information Teach Starter
            holds from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure
            including when Teach Starter sends Personal Information offshore.&nbsp; Further, Teach
            Starter takes reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify Personal
            Information if it is no longer needed for the purpose it was collected.
          </li>
          <li>
            Teach Starter takes reasonable steps to ensure that the Personal Information Teach

          <li>
            Teach Starter will comply with the requirements of the Notifiable Data Breaches Scheme
            under the Act, including:
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
              <li>
                identifying relevant data breaches and whether the data breach would be likely to
                result in serious harm to a User whose Personal Information was part of the data
                breach,
              </li>
              <li>notification to Users who are possibly affected and the relevant authority,</li>
              <li>
                instituting remedial action, make recommendations about steps that Users should take
                and any remedial action which Teach Starter has taken or may in future take in
                relation to the data breach.

            </ol>

          <li>
            In some circumstances the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
            provides additional protection to individuals located in Europe. The fact that Users may
            be in Europe does not on its own entitle them to protection under the GDPR. The Site
            does not specifically target Users located in the EU and Teach Starter does not monitor
            the behaviour of individuals in the EU and therefore the GDPR does not apply.

        <h3>Part Three</h3>
        <h2>1. Children’s Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
          This Children’s Online Privacy Policy sets forth information which is relevant to Personal
          Information provided by children under the age of 12 (“child” or “children”). All of our
          Terms &amp; Conditions, the terms of our Privacy Policy and the Terms of our Privacy
          Policy Applicable to the United States are integrated and incorporated herein by
          reference.
        </p>
        <p>
          This policy is in accordance with the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act
          (“COPPA”), and outlines our practices in the United States. For more information about
          COPPA and general tips about protecting children’s online privacy, please visit the
          Federal Trade Commission’s link
          <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0031-protecting-your-childs-privacy-online"
            >OnGuard Online</a
          >, “Protecting Your Child’s Privacy Online”
        </p>
        <p>
          When we collect Personal Information from a child, namely anyone below the age of 13, we
          shall hold that information only so long as, in our view, it is reasonably necessary to
          fulfill or engage in certain activities that we offer or allow the child to continue to
          participate in such activities. In this regard it is our aim and ensure the security of
          such Personal Information and that our practices are compliant with existing laws and
          regulations. If we learn that we have collected information from a child in a manner
          inconsistent with COPPA’s requirements, we will either delete the information or
          immediately request the parent’s consent for that collection.
        </p>
        <h3>1.1 Registration</h3>
        <p>
          Children can, in many cases, register on our website. In this process it is possible that
          we may ask the child to provide certain information for notification and security
          purposes, including a parent or guardian’s email address, the child’s first name and
          gender, the child’s username, and password, birth dates from children to validate their
          ages. Children can choose whether to share their information with us, but certain features
          cannot function without it. As a result, children may not be able to access certain
          features if required information has not been provided. We strongly recommend that
          registration by a child be closely supervised by a parent or a guardian
        </p>
        <p>
          When we determine that the user is age 13 or under, we will request that the child or a
          parent or guardian supervising the child provide the parent’s or guardian’s email address
          before we collect any personal information from the child. If you believe your child is
          participating in an activity that collects personal information and you or another
          parent/guardian have NOT received an email providing notice or seeking your consent,
          please feel free to contact us via our Security Officer, contact information above.
        </p>
        <h3>1.2 Content Generated by a Child</h3>
        <p>
          Whenever an activity potentially allows a child to insert personal information in their
          created content, we will use our best efforts to either pre-screen the submission to
          delete any personal information, or we will seek verifiable parental consent by email for
          the collection.
        </p>
        <h4>About Verifiable Parental Consent:</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Email Consent.</strong> In the event Teach Starter wishes to collect personal
          information from a child, COPPA requires that we first seek a parent or guardian’s consent
          by email. In the email we will explain what information we are collecting, how we plan to
          use it, how the parent can provide consent, and how the parent can revoke consent. If we
          do not receive parental consent within a reasonable time, we will delete the parent
          contact information and any other information collected from the child in connection with
          that activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Teacher consent in lieu of a parent.</strong> With regard to school-based
          activities, COPPA allows teachers and school administrators to act in the place of parents
          to provide consent for the collection of personal information from children. Schools
          should always notify parents about these activities.
        </p>
        <h3>1.3 Email Contact with a Child</h3>
        <p>
          On occasion, in order to respond to a question or request from a child, Teach Starter may
          need to ask for the child’s online contact information, such as an email address. Teach
          Starter will delete this information immediately after responding to the question or
          request.
        </p>
        <p>
          In connection with certain activities or services, we may collect a child’s online contact
          information, such as an email address, in order to communicate with the child more than
          once. In such instances we will retain the child’s online contact information to honor the
          request and for no other purpose such as marketing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following activities will always require the child to provide a parent’s email
          address, (i) the ability to receive push notifications, and/or (ii) geolocation
          information. Once we have such email we shall contact the parent or guardian for
          permission in regard to the two foregoing activities.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Exceptions to Parental Approvals</strong></p>
        <p>
          There may be certain instances where, of necessity, we may have to share or disclose
          Personal Information regarding your child and you acknowledge that in such instances we
          have the right to do so:
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
          <li>
            Pursuant to a court order, subpoena, a request from law enforcement or governmental
            agency,
          </li>
          <li>
            If in our opinion the disclosure would prevent a criminal act or assist in the public
            welfare or relate to the safety of a child
          </li>
          <li>To enable our service providers to perform business or support services for us.</li>
          <li>To insure the child’s welfare and safety, for example the prevention of a crime</li>
          <li>To insulate us from potential liability</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          At any time, parents can refuse to permit us to collect further personal information from
          their children in association with a particular account, and can request that we delete
          from our records the personal information we have collected in connection with that
          account. Please keep in mind that a request to delete records may lead to a termination of
          an account, membership, or other service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where a child has registered for a Teach Starter account, parents can request access or
          deletion of information in the child’s account by addressing a request to our Security
          Officer, contact information above. When contacting our Security Officer please include
          the child’s username and the parent’s email address and telephone number. To protect
          children’s privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify a parent’s
          identity before granting access to any personal information.
